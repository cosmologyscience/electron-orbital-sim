# Electron Orbital Simulation

Interactive visualization of electron orbital dynamics and E-field patterns. Simulates one or two electrons orbiting a proton, showing how wave interference could explain atomic shell structure. Features adjustable orbital parameters to explore pattern formation.

## Features

- Visualize E-field wave patterns from orbiting electrons
- Single and dual electron configurations
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Orbital radius
  - Orbital speed
  - Spin rate
  - Ripple length
- Full screen mode
- Pause/resume with ESC key
- Color-coded electron paths and ripples
- Real-time interference pattern visualization

## Usage

The simulation can be run directly in any modern web browser. Controls are provided through an intuitive interface:

- Use sliders to adjust orbital and spin parameters
- Watch how interference patterns change at different radii
- Observe wave interactions between electrons
- Press ESC to pause and examine patterns
- Switch between different views using top navigation

## Technical Details

Built using:
- HTML5 Canvas
- Pure JavaScript
- No external dependencies

## Theory

This visualization explores how quantum atomic behavior might emerge from classical wave mechanics:
- Electron spin creates regular E-field emissions
- Orbital motion generates interference patterns
- Stable configurations occur at specific radii
- Shell structure could result from wave interactions

## Integration

The simulation can be easily embedded in web pages or modified for different visualization needs. All code is self-contained and documented.

## View Options

- Normal View: Standard window with controls
- Full Screen: Maximized visualization
- Two Colors: Enhanced pattern distinction
